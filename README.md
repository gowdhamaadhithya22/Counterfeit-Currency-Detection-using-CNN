**Counterfeit Currency Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks**

This project implements a CNN-based system to classify genuine and counterfeit currency banknotes.

**Project Goals:**

- Develop a robust and accurate counterfeit currency detection system.
- Leverage the power of CNNs for image feature extraction and classification.
- Contribute to financial security by providing a potential solution for combating counterfeit currency.

**Features:**

- **CNN Architecture:** A well-defined CNN architecture tailored for counterfeit currency detection (details provided in the code).
- **Image Preprocessing:** Techniques for image normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance model performance (implemented using `ImageDataGenerator`).
- **Training and Evaluation:** Comprehensive training scripts with clear instructions for hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- **Prediction Function:** A function (`predict_currency`) to predict the authenticity of a currency image using the trained model.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/counterfeit-currency-detection.git
   ```
2. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Install required dependencies (list dependencies in the README).
   - Ensure you have a compatible deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow with Keras) installed (`pip install tensorflow keras`).
3. **Prepare Dataset:**
   - Download and preprocess your dataset of genuine and counterfeit currency images (instructions provided or linked to external resources if applicable).
   - Organize the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets (modify paths in `train_data_dir` and `test_data_dir` variables if needed).
4. **Train the Model:**
   - Run the training script (`python train.py`) with appropriate parameters (learning rate, epochs, etc.).
   - Monitor training progress (loss, accuracy) using TensorBoard or other visualization tools.
5. **Evaluate the Model:**
   - Execute the evaluation script (`python evaluate.py`) to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
   - Analyze the results (classification report, confusion matrix) to identify potential areas for improvement.
6. **Prediction:**
   - Use the `predict_currency` function to predict the authenticity of a new currency image by providing its path.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Dataset:** The quality and size of your dataset significantly impact model performance. Consider using a balanced dataset with a sufficient number of genuine and counterfeit examples.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different learning rates, optimizer configurations, and network architectures to potentially improve model performance.
- **Class Imbalance:** If your dataset is imbalanced (more genuine than counterfeit notes), consider using class weights during training to address potential bias.
- **Transfer Learning:** Explore using pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) fine-tuned for counterfeit currency detection.
- **Deployment:** Consider legal and ethical implications before deploying this technology in real-world applications. Potential use cases could involve integrating it into mobile apps or bank systems (ensure appropriate security measures are in place).
